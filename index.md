### __Armor Training Command__ `2015.3 - 2016.2`
- Mandatory Military Service

## __Job Objective__
>Before working on Quanta, I never had practical experience in unix-like system. When I began to access project, I just understood the different between kernel and user space. On the power function, I learned not only basic module concept but also device tree and sysfs, it's the most important thing as bring up the device. Besides, I needed to implement dead battery charging on boot-loader, so it also have to port charger and gauge to here. HAL and Android framework are the most important part on AOSP, but I seldom have much research on this. Therefore, I hoped that future job would involve this.

>Between studying Linux kernel, I lived by the motto,"Read the fucking source code". Based on reading the source code, I just know how to write C language. 

## Miscellaneous
- Programming language: C, C++, Markdown
- Interests: Badminton, World of Warcraft, Hearthstone
- Favorite reference book:
>- LDD, APUE, CSAPP, UNIX Network programming, The Linux Programming Interface
- Favorite reference website:
>- [Bootlin](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source), [NCKU csie wiki](http://wiki.csie.ncku.edu.tw/)
