### __Armor Training Command__ `2015.3 - 2016.2`
- Mandatory Military Service

## Job Objective
>- Andoir/HAL framework: <br />
After porting driver, hoping that I could implement corresponding program to access driver.
Many useful IPC I learend but not practiced in actual project.

>- Linux kernel framework: <br />
>Because of using turnkey soluton on each project, our exteranl driver have to follow Qcom/MTK
>architecture. I want to implement or touch new architecture which never face.

>- Java/Python: <br />
Between reading the answer of leetcode test, I learned much new language feature and tried
to taste it in actual project.
